# MelodyGen

Melody Generator Built On Top Of Google's Magenta Designed To Work With The MIMIC Platform

[Full demo with usage here.](https://github.com/bkudler/MelodyGenWithMaxiWithLearner). The demo works with a pre-existing project in the [MIMIC platform](https://mimicproject.com/), but this library can be used with any project on MIMIC, including newly created ones, used as a standalone to create melody patterns, or used with any other online synth.
